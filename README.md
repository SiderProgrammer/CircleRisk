Circle Risk android game source code :)

Link to the Google Play Store : https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pip.circlerisk
Graphics were made by my brother.
Client is written in Phaser 3.

I learned a lot from developing this game.

Folders should have a different structure. Some files should have different names.
There is a lot of spaghetti code.
I see many other mistakes that could be corrected like : code repetition, bad functions names and so on.
Many features could be implemented easier, shorter, cleaner.

How do I rate my code? - Medium level :C
